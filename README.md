# Geolocation

## Introduction

This is the sample webpage that will check to see if the current browser supports the navigator.geolocation object. If the browser does not support geolocation then have the page display an feedback message to the user.

If geolocation is supported then try to fetch the user's current location and then load a google STATIC map that includes a marker at the center of the map.


## HTML5 geolocation

One of the new APIs that was made available as part of the evolution of HTML is Geolocation. That is the ability for the browser to return a device's latitude and longitude based on actual GPS data, ISP, IP address, or wi-fi network.
