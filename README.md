# Geolocation

## HTML5 geolocation

One of the new APIs that was made available as part of the evolution of HTML is Geolocation. That is the ability for the browser to return a device's latitude and longitude based on actual GPS data, ISP, IP address, or wi-fi network.

CODEPEN [Example](http://codepen.io/mad-d/pen/mymOBy?editors=101 "geolocation")

Step one is determining if the device / browser supports geolocation.

*if( navigator.geolocation ){ 
  //code goes here to find position
}*

Once you know that it is supported then you can write the code to use it.
